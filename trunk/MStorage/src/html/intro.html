<h1>Tree Demo</h1>

This is the help file (<code>TreeDemoHelp.html</code>)
for the tree demo.
Selecting any branch node in the tree results 
in this file being displayed.
When you select a leaf node (a book),
this pane displays an HTML file for that book.

This demo uses a split pane
to separate the tree and this HTML view.
Drag the divider up or down to change the space distribution.

The argument to the DefaultMutableTreeNode constructor is the user object which is an object that contains or points to the data associated with the tree node. The user object can be a string, or it can be a custom object. If you implement a custom object, you should implement its toString method so that it returns the string to be displayed for that node. JTree, by default, renders each node using the value returned from toString, so it is important that toString returns something meaningful. Sometimes, it is not feasible to override toString; in such a scenario you can override the convertValueToText of JTree to map the object from the model into a string that gets displayed.

For example, the BookInfo class used in the previous code snippet is a custom class that holds two pieces of data: the name of a book, and the URL for an HTML file describing the book. The toString method is implemented to return the book name. Thus, each node associated with a BookInfo object displays a book name.
