How to run many instances of MStorage
</h1>

<p>
Sometimes you will need to have many storages on your hard drive with many running instances of MStorage.
</p>

<p>
MStorage saves some settings for your convenience in future. It save all yours settings in your home directory in .MStorage/settings. If all running instances of MStorage will use the same settings, they will be confuse each other and no one will work right. 
</p>

<p>
As cure, for each application you can set different name of settings file. You have to for the end of your launch app command add a option: 
    <pre>
    --settings=name_of_settings_file
    </pre>
</p>

<p>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    
    For Windows:
        
    <pre>
        javaw -jar "E:\dev\java\MStorage\release\MStorage.jar" --settings=name_of_settings_file
    </pre>
    
    or for Linux:
    
    <pre>
        java -jar "/usr/local/Mstorage/MStorage.jar" --settings=name_of_settings_file
    </pre>
</p>

<p>
After this, all settings of this instance of application will save in ~/.MStorage/name_of_settings_file.
